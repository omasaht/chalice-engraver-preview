## Laser Chalice Engraver Application

This was a minor project that I did at Insight Corporation. For this project, I had to integrate hardware with software and also develop a touch application that would run on edge device installed on chalice engraver. This was my second project on Kivy. After getting hands-on experience with embedded application and Kivy, I was able to develop a much more polished application than previous toolbox application.

### Application Video

The following video highlights some of the features of the application.
